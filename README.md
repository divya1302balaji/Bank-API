# Bank-API


This project implements a GraphQL API for retrieving information about Indian banks and their branches. It uses **FastAPI**, **Strawberry GraphQL**, and a pre-filled **SQLite database** (`data.db`). The goal is to provide an efficient, scalable backend that supports querying relational data using modern Python tools.

---

##  Features

- GraphQL endpoint at `/gql`
- Fetch all branches with nested bank information
- SQLite-based lightweight database
- Clean modular code
-Includes sample query and instructions

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Strawberry GraphQL
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite (for demo)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

## Sample GraphQL Query

You can run the following query at `/gql`:

query {
  branches {
    ifsc
    branch
    bank {
      name
    }
  }
}
